## Computer Science
There are series of good courses in CS as personal preference, some

* [MIT 6.006](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-006-introduction-to-algorithms-fall-2011/lecture-videos/)
Very good Computer Science Video Lectures, broad topic overview. Medium level of complexity. Some topics - e.g. dynamic programming are brilliant.

* [MIT 6.046](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-046j-design-and-analysis-of-algorithms-spring-2015/lecture-videos/)
Next step to advance knowledge after 6.006, level considered as Medium+. Good description of FFT, Graph algorithms. Recommended after 6.006
